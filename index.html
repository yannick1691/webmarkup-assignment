						<h4>The many great activities in Amsterdam</h4>
						<p>Amsterdam is commonly known around the world for its weed and the red-light district. But there is a lot more to Amsterdam than that, and there is definitely a lot more to do then that. You could take a boat tour through the canals of Amsterdam or visit one of the many great museums like the Van Gogh Museum or the Rijksmuseum. You could also visit the Anne Frank House, where you can get a look back in time into the life and hiding of Anne Frank during WW2.</p>

						<h4>TonTon Club</h4>
						<p>If you’re more into casual activities, then try visiting the TonTon Club. The TonTon Club is an arcade hall with a bunch of Japanese arcade games such as Mario kart and Pac-Man. There’s always a bunch of people here and it has a great mood. If you’re in to arcade games, then you are guaranteed to leave this place full of joy. The TonTon Club has multiple locations so for more info you should visit their website.</p>

					<p>Bos & Lommer is a quick upcoming neighborhood, with new clubs and coffee places turning up. If you are looking for a great place to go for a drink or something to eat in combination with some entertainment, then you should head over to the Podium Mozaïek. This restaurant is also a theater. Podium Mozaïek has something for young and old, with performances ranging from theater to music and comedy shows. Besides being a place that delivers great food in combination with entertainment, it’s also the place that brings together cultures. As this is part of their mission, you will also see this in the menu, with great meals from a bunch of different cultures. Podium Mozaïek is open on Monday to Friday from 10:00 till 23:00, and on Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 till 00:00.</p>

					<p>If you’re more into a nice walk in the park, then you can head over to the Erasmus Park. If you are visiting in the summer then you should also head over to the Terrasmus, where you can grab something to drink with something to eat. The staff at Terrasmus are very friendly and helpful and in addition to that they also have great coffee. They are opened daily from 10:00 till 18:00 though with great weather they tend to stay open a bit longer.</p>

					<p>If you have kids you can also head over to the Candy Castle, which is an indoor child playground. Inside you will fill a climbing castle where the children can play in. In addition to this there are also a lot of play balls from the ball pit. The Candy Castle is open to kids from the age of 1 till 12, and has its doors open every day from 09:00 till 19:00.</p>

					<p>If you are interested in getting some great pizza, then head on over to Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman. This pizzeria is founded by two neighbors who wanted to start a pizzeria together, they decided to do this by fixing up a corner building that had been empty for a while. Eetwinkel Buurman & Buurman is now a great spot for pizza that gets made from fresh ingredients in a Italian wood-fired oven.</p>
